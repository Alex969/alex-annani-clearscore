# Insigths tech test - Alex Annani 

I had a lot of fun ! Thank you for the assignment, it was a great way to peek at what I could be doing at ClearScore and it actually was a great occasion for me to learn more about media queries and really feel more and more comfortable with custom react hooks.
I did spend too much time on it though, around 10 hours to try and complete pretty much every requirement. 
I've added some comments as to how and why I did things the way I did which hopefully will give a better insight on my code !

A few lines to run to make sure everything runs smoothly : 

`````
yarn add react-elastic-carousel
yarn add styled-components
yarn add @types/styled-components
yarn add --dev @babel/preset-typescript
yarn add ts/node
yarn add msw 
yarn add @testing-library/react-hooks
`````


Have fun reviewing it !
